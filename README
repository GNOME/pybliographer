=================================================================

Pybliographer provides a framework for working with bibliographic
databases.

For more information, please consult the documentation at:

	http://www.gnome.org/pybliographer

=================================================================

* Installation 
  ------------

Basically, it should look like :

	./configure && make
	su
	make install

You can then run several programs :

  - pybliographic : the graphical interface
  - pybliographer : the text-based interface and scripting language
  - pybcheck, pybconvert, pybformat, ... : several useful tools

For more configuration details, have a look at ./INSTALL and try ./configure --help


* RedHat & Debian users
  ---------------------

Please  check  that  python  and  recode  have  their  devel  packages
installed. For *Debian*, this means that the following packages should
be present :

	python-base
	python-dev
	python-gdk-imlib
	python-gnome
	python-gtk
	python-misc
	python-net
	python-tk

(thanks to Yuri Bongiorno for having isolated the minimal required list ;-))


* Common problems
  ---------------

 - If you get a message like "don't know how to open .bib", or some
   weird error about librecode.so, please try:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib

   (assuming recode has been installed in /usr or /usr/local...)


 - If the interface locks during search or open operations, or if you
   experience core dumps and random crashes, upgrade
   your versions of Gtk (>= 1.2.6) and Gnome-Python (>= 1.0.52).
