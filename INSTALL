Simple install procedure
========================

% gzip -d -c pybliographer-<x.y.z>.tar.gz | tar xvf -
% cd pybliographer-<x.y.z>
% ./configure
% make
[become root if necessary]
% make install

The  ./configure  step  requires  that  you  can  connect  to  your  X
server.  This may  not  be the  case  if you  compile  the program  as
root. In this case, simply compile  as a user, and become root for the
last step of the installation.

For additional configuration options, please run `configure --help'
