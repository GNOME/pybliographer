AB  - BACKGROUND: Several retrospective and prospective studies report an
      increased prevalence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies (NOSAs) in
      patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related chronic liver disease
      (CLD). Some of the data so far available are controversial and the true
      prevalence of NOSAs in the general population is still not known. AIM:
      To explore the prevalence of NOSAs, their relation to different HCV
      genotypes, and the presence and severity of CLD in the general
      population of Northern Italy. PATIENTS: All 226 anti-HCV positive and
      87 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients of the
      Dionysos cohort study were analysed and compared with sex and age
      matched cases (226) negative for both anti-HCV antibody and HBsAg
      selected from the same cohort. METHODS: Sera tested for the presence of
      NOSAs (anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA),
      and anti-liver/kidney microsomes type 1 antibody (LKM1)) were screened
      by indirect immunofluorescence at a 1:40 serum dilution. HCV RNA and
      HCV genotypes were also determined by nested polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) of the 5' non-coding region and by PCR amplification of the core
      region with type specific primers. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of
      NOSA reactivity was significantly higher in anti-HCV positive subjects
      than in both normal and pathological controls (25% v 6% and 7%
      respectively, p<0.05). ANA, SMA, and LKM1 occurred in 16, 10, and 1. 3%
      of cases respectively. No specific association between NOSAs and a
      specific HCV genotype was found. NOSAs were found more often associated
      with more than one genotype (35.7%) and with untypable genotypes
      (34.6%), although the association was not statistically significant.
      NOSAs were associated with HCV RNA and CLD but not with the presence of
      cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. On univariate analysis, NOSA
      reactivity was independently associated with abnormal alanine
      aminotransferase (p<0.01) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels
      (p<0.05). The risk for the presence of NOSAs was 5.1 times higher in
      anti-HCV subjects than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the general
      population the prevalence of NOSAs is higher in anti-HCV positive
      subjects than in normal or disease controls. Moreover NOSAs are
      associated with CLD and with a more active disease in terms of alanine
      aminotransferase activity.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been implicated in the development of a
      variety of autoimmune phenomena, some of which are well documented and
      include a panel of auto-antibodies shared with autoimmune hepatitis
      (AIH). Anti-nuclear (ANA) and smooth muscle (SMA) antibodies (markers
      of AIH type 1 [AIH-1]), have been demonstrated in 9-38% and 5-91% of
      cases respectively, whereas anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 (anti-
      LKM-1) and anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibodies (anti-LC1) (markers of
      AIH type 2 [AIH-2]), are definitely rarer, especially in adults. The
      presence of these auto-reactivities in chronic hepatitis C generates
      clinical overlaps and dilemmas in the correct classification and
      treatment of such patients. The immunopathological characterization of
      the auto-antibodies, anti-nuclear and smooth muscle antibodies in
      particular, combined with internationally defined criteria for the
      diagnosis of AIH is helpful in this clinical process. Thyroid auto-
      antibodies and cryoprecitable rheumatoid factors are also commonly
      detected in hepatitis C, while the occurrence of other auto-antibodies
      still awaits confirmation.

AB  - Acute and severe impairment of liver function with jaundice and ascites
      occurred in two out of seven patients with chronic hepatitis D during
      interferon alpha administration (10 MU three times a week). Both of
      them were young women with histological diagnoses of moderate to severe
      chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis with no signs of portal hypertension.
      Only a slow and partial recovery was observed after interferon
      withdrawal. Autoantibodies against basal cell layer tested positive in
      these two patients. In the remaining five patients with hepatitis D who
      did not experience liver impairment during interferon administration,
      basal cell layer antibodies were found only in one case. We conclude
      that severe decompensation of liver cirrhosis related to hepatitis D
      may occur during interferon administration. Positivity of basal cell
      layer antibodies may be associated with the risk of developing such an
      adverse event but our data are not sufficient to prove this association.

AB  - Liver Kidney Microsomal type 1 (LKM1) antibody, the diagnostic marker
      of autoimmune hepatitis type 2, is also found in a proportion of
      patients with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV). It is detected
      conventionally by the subjective immunofluorescence technique. Our aim
      was to establish a simple and objective enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA) that measures antibodies to cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6),
      the target of LKM1. An indirect ELISA using eukaryotically expressed
      CYP2D6 was designed. Absorbance values obtained against a reference
      microsomal preparation were subtracted from those obtained against a
      microsomal preparation over-expressing CYP2D6, thus removing the non-
      CYP2D6-specific reaction. Sera from 51 LKM1 positive patients (21
      autoimmune hepatitis and 30 with HCV infection), 111 LKM1 negative
      patients with chronic liver disease (including 20 with HCV infection)
      and 43 healthy controls were tested. Of 51 patients positive by
      immunofluorescence, 48 were also positive by ELISA while all the 154
      LKM1 negative subjects were also negative by ELISA. There was a high
      degree of association between IFL and ELISA as demonstrated by a kappa
      reliability value of 0.96. The absorbance values by ELISA correlated
      with immunofluorescence LKM1 titres both in autoimmune hepatitis (r =
      0.74, p < 0.001) and HCV infection (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). The simple,
      objective ELISA described has the potential to replace the standard
      immunofluorescence technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertransaminasaemia of unknown, cryptogenic, origin
      occasionally has been found to be the only sign of coeliac disease.
      Raised concentrations of transaminases, or aminotransferases, have been
      retrospectively observed in about a half of patients with coeliac
      disease who are on a gluten-containing diet. We aimed to establish the
      overall prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with cryptogenic
      hypertransaminasaemia. METHODS: Of the 600 consecutive patients
      referred to our outpatient clinic for liver disease due to raised serum
      transaminases from September, 1995, to June, 1997, 55 were classified
      as having cryptogenic hypertransaminasaemia after the exclusion of
      every known cause of liver disease. These patients were tested by
      indirect immunofluorescence for IgA to endomysium and for IgA and IgG
      to gliadin. FINDINGS: Five patients were positive for both IgA to
      endomysium and IgG to gliadin, whereas IgA to gliadin was only found in
      four patients. IgG to gliadin was also present in another patient who
      was not positive for antibodies to endomysium. The six antibody-
      positive patients had duodenal biopsy that showed a subtotal villous
      atrophy consistent with coeliac disease in the five patients with
      antibodies to endomysium. The patient with only IgG to gliadin had a
      normal small-intestine mucosa. None of the five patients with coeliac
      disease had gastrointestinal symptoms. Liver biopsy samples were taken
      from three of the five patients with flat mucosa and showed a
      histological picture of nonspecific reactive hepatitis. Transaminase
      concentrations reverted to normal within 6 months in four patients with
      coeliac disease who followed a strict gluten-free diet. INTERPRETATION:
      Our results show that about 9% of patients with cryptogenic
      hypertransaminasaemia are affected by symptom-free coeliac disease.
      Gluten-sensitive enteropathy and antibody screening for coeliac disease
      by means of antibodies to endomysium and gliadin should be considered
      in these patients.

AB  - Celiac disease has been associated with autoimmune disorders, but its
      frequency in autoimmune hepatitis is unknown. Sera from 157 patients
      with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, 24 patients with type 2 autoimmune
      hepatitis, 62 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 30 patients with
      chronic hepatitis B, and 80 patients with chronic hepatitis C were
      tested for immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies by indirect
      immunofluorescence and immunoglobulin A and G antibodies to gliadin by
      enzyme immunoassay. Duodenal biopsy evaluation was recommended in
      patients seropositive for immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies.
      Immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial antibodies were present in eight of
      the 181 patients with autoimmune hepatitis (4%), including six with
      type 1 disease (4%) and two with type 2 disease (8%). Immunoglobulin A
      antibodies to gliadin were found in six of these eight patients, but
      they were also present in two others, including one patient with
      chronic hepatitis C. Five of the eight patients with immunoglobulin A
      antiendomysial antibodies, including three patients with no
      gastrointestinal symptoms, had duodenal biopsies and subtotal villous
      atrophy was present in all of them. No patient with primary biliary
      cirrhosis or chronic viral hepatitis had antiendomysial antibodies. The
      presence of celiac disease in autoimmune hepatitis is high (at least
      one in 36 patients) and it is predominantly asymptomatic. Screening
      with anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin antibodies should be performed
      and results confirmed with intestinal biopsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver/kidney microsomal antibody type 1 (LKM1) and liver
      cytosol antibody type 1 (LC1) are the serological markers of type 2
      autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). AIMS: Since LKM1 and LC1 react against two
      distinct liver specific autoantigens (cytochrome P450IID6 (CYP2D6) and
      a 58 kDa cytosolic polypeptide respectively), the aim was to see
      whether LKM1 and LC1 concentrations correlate with liver disease
      activity. PATIENTS: Twenty one patients with type 2 AIH were studied.
      METHODS: All sera were tested by indirect immunofluorescence,
      counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and immunoblotting visualised by enhanced
      chemiluminescence. To evaluate LKM1 and LC1 levels, the 50 kDa
      microsomal reactivity (corresponding to CYP2D6) and the 58 kDa
      cytosolic reactivity were quantified by densitometric analysis.
      RESULTS: Seven patients were positive for LKM1, nine for LC1, and five
      for both. Serial serum samples at onset and during immunosuppressive
      treatment were analysed in 13 patients (four positive for LKM1, six
      positive for LC1 and three positive for both). During remission, LKM1
      concentration remained essentially unchanged in six of seven patients,
      and decreased in only one. Conversely, in two of nine patients, LC1 was
      completely lost, and, in the remaining seven, LC1 concentration was
      reduced by more than 50%. After immunosuppression tapering or
      withdrawal, flare ups of liver necrosis ensued with increasing LC1
      concentration, but not LKM1. CONCLUSIONS: LC1 concentration, at
      variance with that of LKM1, parallels liver disease activity, and its
      participation in the pathogenic mechanisms of liver injury can be
      hypothesised.

AB  - Recently the main targets of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) of
      primary biliary cirrhosis have been identified as parts of three
      related mitochondrial multienzyme complexes, namely pyruvate
      dehydrogenase (PDH), branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BKDH)
      and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha-KGDH). Usually AMA-
      positive PBC serum samples show reactivity to more than one of these,
      raising the question whether they are exclusively different antibodies
      or are, at least in part, the result of cross-reactive specificities.
      With Western immunoblotting, four antigens with molecular masses of 74,
      52, 51 and 43 kDa, are recognized by PBC sera. In this study, using
      affinity purified antibodies from mitochondrial proteins immobilized on
      nitrocellulose blots, we demonstrate the presence of peptide-specific
      and cross-reactive epitopes in some targets. In particular, at least
      three different epitopes present in the 74-kDa protein (presumed to by
      PDH-E2) are also present in the 51-kDa protein (probably PDH-X), and
      two in the 52-kDa peptide (possibly BCKDH-E2). Moreover, the 43-kDa
      mitochondrial protein (the identity of which is more problematic) has
      three epitopes. One of these is also present in the 74-, 52- and 51-kDa
      proteins, a second in the 74- and 51-kDa, and a third seems to be
      peptide-specific. These results show that different sera with the same
      immunoblotting pattern of reactivity can have antibodies with different
      antigenic specificities and, conversely, that the same specificity can
      be responsible for more than one band.
