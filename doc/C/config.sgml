    <para>The configuration system is heavily based on python's module
    system. The configuration files are standard &pyb; scripts (that
    is, python code making use of &pyb; extra classes and functions),
    whose single special feature is to be automatically parsed at
    startup. </para>

      <title>Files involved</title>

      <para>The      first     file      to      be     parsed      is
    <filename>${prefix}/share/pybliographer/pybrc.py</filename>.     It
    defines the most basic characteristics of the system:</para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>structure of the bibliographies being parsed (an article
	can contain an author, a title, ...)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>site wide specific features (use of some non standard
	fields)</para>
	</listitem>	  

	<listitem>
	  <para>available input and output formats</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>several format and front-end specific features</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para>This  file   in  turn  usually   indicates  a  configuration
    directory.  All  the  files  in  this  directory  are  parsed  (in
    alphabetical order). This mechanism allows more flexibility to add
    new  formats: the  new  format  can be  installed  with a  default
    configuration  without  messing   with  the  global  configuration
    file.</para>
      
      <para>Finally,    if   the   user    provides   a    file   called
    <filename>.pybrc.py</filename> in its home directory, this file is
    then parsed. Of course it  can also define a private configuration
    directory, and override what has been defined before.</para>

      <title>The <classname>Config</classname> module</title>
      
      <para>All the data that can be configured should be handled by
      the so-called <classname>Config</classname> module. It provides
      a standard interface to set/get and document configuration
      topics.</para>
      
      <para>The module provides the following functions:</para>
