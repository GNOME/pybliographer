\chapter{Adding Access Points}
\label{cha:addacc}

This chapter explains how you can add access points to a record to
make it easily retrievable in your database.
Among the possible access points are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Standard numbers, such as the \textit{International Standard
    Book Number} (ISBN)
\item Control numbers, as used by the Library of Congress to identify
  records
\item Subject headings, classification codes, and uniform titles to
  gather similar items
\item Uncontrolled keywords, and authority files, to cope with
  spelling variations and the like
\item Relations to persons or other items, as in the case of
  biographies, or reviews
\end{itemize}
