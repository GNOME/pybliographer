      is preceded according to AACR practice with a small <tt>c</tt>.

      There are other dates that are of importance, if only in special
      cases. the most important class associates the item with an
      event: the promulgation of a law, the signing of a treaty, the
      convening of a congress, the formal revision of a technical
      document and so on. 

      Dates are as well associated (as distinguishing marks) with
      persons, or other items, and form part of, or define historical
      subjects.
