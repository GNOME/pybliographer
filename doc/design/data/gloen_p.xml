  <GlossEntry>
    <GlossTerm>Person</GlossTerm>
    <GlossDef>
      An individual (or whoever appears to be an individual, Nicholas
      Bourbaki, say). There are two ways to handle persons in
      bibliography, as individuals or as names. For searching, the
      latter is usually sufficient, so this the German usage until the
      present. The American usage is informed by the idea of the
      dictionary catalogue, where works about an author are listed
      next to works by him, requiring the use of individualised
      entries from early on.

      No rules without exception. If there is insufficient information
      (or interest) one may eschew the work needed for determining the
      correct author entry; on the other hand, for the purpose of
      subject headings, one buildt a German authority file, too; with
      funnily different rules.

  <GlossEntry>
    <GlossTerm>Publication</GlossTerm>
    <GlossDef>
      The preparation (e.g. typesetting), manufacture and distribution
      of copies of an item (manifestation). Generally done by a
      separate commercial entity, the publisher. For items that are
      not conventionnally printed, this is rapidly becoming a
      problematic notion. For material that is not somehow
      manufactured, but, say only made available as a computer file,
      the notion is fundamentally flawed, it appears.
