    <title>Classifier</title>
    <summary>
      A formal characteristic of an entry, such as language, general
      material designation, or publication type. For display purposes
      assimilated to subject headings or similar classifications.

      Differs from subject headings by being better controlled and
      taken from a much smaller vocabulary, thus able to control
      processing. Examples are indicators for review, festschrift,
      biography, which all imply a subject person or publication, or
      language together with a uniform title which implies a
      translation.
