   <title>Modified Search</title>

  <summary>A search that was not fully satisfying is done again with
    slight variations or on the result set to further reduce it.

    During a search, frequency unknown.

  <precondition>
    Database is selected, a search as been performed, but was not
    fully satisfying. 
  </precondition>
  <postcondition>
    Results set or error indication
  </postcondition>
    <error>
    </error>
    <sequence>
    <item>Examine result set (or error indication)</item>
    <item>Correct search term (go to index, if needed)</item>
    <item>Narrow or widen search</item>
    <item>Select another database</item>
    <item>restrict search to a result set.</item>
    </sequence>
    <note>
      The particularity here is that the result of the prior search is
      effectively ignored, except when we are narrowing our search. So
      we must distinguish this situation from the other one, that I
      search for a list of authors etc., one after the other, and with
      the intent to combine the results.
