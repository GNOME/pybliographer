\chapter{Holdings Information}
\label{cha:hold}

This chapter discusses the use of data that serves to provide access
to an item itself, we call it \textit{holdings information}, using the
librarian's specific term in a broader sense. This information is used
to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which institution (usually library) has a copy
\item Where do I find it (exact location, call sign)
\item How can I obtain on-line access to the item
\item Where did I put the copy that I made
\end{itemize}
