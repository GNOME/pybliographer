\chapter{Modifying Records}
\label{cha:umodify}

This chapter describes how to modify records, either those that are
already in the database, or temporary ones that are in the process of
being created or imported.

\begin{itemize}
\item You can edit a record, in most cases, by simply displaying it
  and changing the data in the entry mask
\item In some cases, you will have to switch to another view or
  to display another object
\item Often, however, it will be better to use programatic means, such
  as search and replace. 
\item Special considerations apply if you want to change associations
  between records, i.e., to correct the association between a work and
  a person.
\end{itemize}
