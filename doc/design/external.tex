\subsection{Connecting to external databases}
\label{sec:extconn}

Pybliographer uses \textit{connections} to external ressources for the
following purposes:
\begin{itemize}
\item To look up a catalogue (for immediate consumption, so to say),
  i.e., as a client program.
\item To obtain, as a result of a query, additional data for import.
\item To obtain additional documents that are referred to from the
  data base, i.e., via an \textit{URL} or an \textit{Eprints} link.
\item To perform operations on the remote system, i.e., to request
  books or copies by means of an \textit{OPAC}. 
\item \Think To cooperate with other Pybliographers, sharing and
  updating data.

\end{itemize}
